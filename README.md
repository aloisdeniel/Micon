## About

This WPF/[Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) application has been initiated for testing out different frameworks : [ReactiveUI](http://reactiveui.net/), [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody), [Autofac](https://autofac.org/), [Xamarin.Mac](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/mac/).

After some experiments, the application seemed to be useful because of the lack of this type of application so I've decided to actually release it. Consequently, the quality of the code may not be the best I've produced... I apologize for this. Don't hesitate to participate or to make suggestions as github issues.

Thanks to [iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/) for the great icons!
